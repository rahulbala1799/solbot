## Method 2: Railway CLI (Advanced)

railway login
```

This will open your browser for authentication.

### After Login

```bash
cd /Users/rahul/Documents/Crsr/botat1

# Initialize project
railway init

# Set environment variables
railway variables set WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="your_key"
railway variables set TARGET_TOKEN_ADDRESS="your_token"
railway variables set BUY_THRESHOLD_SOL="0.2"
railway variables set SELL_PERCENTAGE="25"
railway variables set SOLANA_RPC_URL="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
railway variables set SOLANA_WSS_URL="wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
railway variables set PUMP_PROGRAM_ID="6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P"

## Monitoring Your Bot

### In Railway Dashboard:

  SOL Amount: 0.5
‚úì Buy threshold met! 0.5 SOL >= 0.2 SOL
‚úì Executing sell order for 25%...
‚úì Sell executed successfully! Signature: [tx_signature]
```
